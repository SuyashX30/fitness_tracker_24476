üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

Database: PostgreSQL

Database Connector: psycopg2-binary

Data Manipulation: Pandas

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

PostgreSQL installed and running.

2. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If this were a Git repository, you would clone it. For now, just ensure you have the required files.

git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd fitness-tracker-app

3. Install Python Dependencies
Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required libraries.

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install libraries
pip install streamlit psycopg2-binary pandas

üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup
You need to create a PostgreSQL database and a user for the application to connect to.

Open psql or your preferred PostgreSQL client.

Create a new database:

CREATE DATABASE fitness_tracker;

Create a new user and grant privileges:
(Replace 'your_secure_password' with a strong password)

CREATE USER fitness_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE fitness_tracker TO fitness_user;

Update Backend Configuration:
Open the Backend_fft.py file and update the connection details with your credentials:

# Backend_fft.py

DB_NAME = "fitness_tracker"
DB_USER = "fitness_user"
DB_PASS = "your_secure_password" # <-- IMPORTANT: Update this line
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = "5432"

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run Frontend_ft.py

Your web browser should automatically open to the application's URL (usually http://localhost:8501). The first time you run it, the backend script will automatically create the necessary tables and seed the database with sample data.
